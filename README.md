# the-jewelry-box

JJJ-Jewelry Box is a functional point of sale system built in Node.JS for boutique jewelry businesses. The program utilizes MySQL as a database, Express.js for server setup, Sequelize.js as an ORM, Handlebars.js for templating, Passport.js for user authentication, and Materialize for front-end CSS. The program allows for users to create and view products, clients, and invoices. It also provides users with a main dashboard that displays key business intelligence from the database.
